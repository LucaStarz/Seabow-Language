# Seabow Programming Language

The seabow programming language is a all-in-one command to manage seabow files. It could interpret seabow source code, pseudo-compile seabow source code into seabow bytecode file and interpret it or compile seabow source code to native executable. It could also be used to create seabow libraries. The main features of this language are the platform-independent source code, the UTF-8 supports and the complete seabow language artefacts management.
